    "### Top Performers\n",
    "- The top 2 players (Gertrude Elwin and Elliana Cole) have significantly higher GOAT scores, indicating they are clear standouts\n",
    "- Both top performers were drafted highly in Round 1 (picks 1-2), suggesting draft positioning had value at the top\n",
    "\n",
    "### Draft Efficiency\n",
    "- Early picks (Round 1) show a mix of high and moderate GOAT scores, with variable draft ratings\n",
    "- Some later picks (Round 2) produced comparable GOAT scores to early picks, indicating draft success wasn't guaranteed\n",
    "- Compare draft_ovr (rating) vs GOAT_Score to see if draft predictions were accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Undrafted Player\n",
    "- Jenni Green is the best undrafted player with a GOAT score of 5,061.87\n",
    "- This places her around mid-Round 2 performance, showing undrafted talent can compete\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Analyze draft rating accuracy (compare draft_ovr predictions to actual GOAT performance)\n",
    "- Identify biggest draft hits and misses\n",
    "- Explore correlation between draft position and career success"
